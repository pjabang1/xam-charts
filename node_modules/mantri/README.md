[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/closureplease/mantri.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/closureplease/mantri)

> **Attention 0.1.x** The current 0.2.x version brings some rather breaking changes. [Read the migration guide for more information][migration].

## **Mantri** is...

* **✓** A Robust and discreet Dependency Management System.
* **✓** Synchronous. Everything is done before [DOMContentLoaded event][DOMContentLoaded] triggers.
* **✓** A [Grunt][] plugin.
* **✓** A command line tool.
* **✓** Cross-browser.

## **Mantri** does not...

* **✗** Dictate how you write your code. Vanilla JS, [AMD][], [commonJS][], knock yourselves out.
* **✗** Need any runtime on your production file.
* **✗** Need any dependency declarations in your production file.
* **✗** Have any problem moving around JS files or folders.
* **✗** Have any problem working with other dependency systems.
* **✗** Polute your namespace. *But you are free to if you want*.

## Getting Started

Mantri consists of the Web Runtime and the Command Line Tools. The Web Runtime's job is to load the files of your application during development. The Command Line Tools perform various tasks like building your application and calculating dependencies.

### Install

In order to get started, you'll want to install Mantri's command line interface (CLI) globally. You may need to use sudo (for OSX, *nix, BSD etc) or run your command shell as Administrator (for Windows) to do this.

```shell
npm install -g mantri-cli --silent
```
This will put the `mantri` command in your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.

Note that installing `mantri-cli` does not install the mantri library! The job of the mantri CLI is simple: run the version of mantri which has been installed in your application. This allows multiple versions of mantri to be installed on the same machine simultaneously.

On your project, install the mantri library localy:

```shell
npm install mantri --silent --save-dev
```

Read the [Getting Started Guide][Getting Started] for a more detailed introduction.

### Two things to keep in mind

* Every time you edit or create a dependency declaration you need to run the [`mantriDeps`][mantriDeps] task or the `mantri deps` command to re-calculate your dependencies.

* Mantri is not meant to be used on your production environment. Whenever you want to deploy your app use the [`mantriBuild`][mantriBuild] task or the `mantri build` command to bundle and minify your application into one file.

## The Web API

Each file should provide a unique namespace and can require any number of other namespaces:

```js
goog.provide('app');

goog.require('app.router');
goog.require('app.controller');
goog.require('app.view');
```

Read more about the [web API in this wiki page][web-wiki]

## Dependencies

[Google Closure Tools][closure-tools] have a couple dependencies, which are reasonable enough for any developer:

* **Node** [Node.js 0.8.0](http://nodejs.org) or later.
* **Java** [Java 1.6](http://java.com/) or later.
* **Python** [Python 2.7](http://python.org/).

## Hands On

The classical ToDo MVC application has been refactored to use the Mantri Dependency System. You can [find the repo  here][ToDoApp], or clone it:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:closureplease/todoAppMantri.git
```
