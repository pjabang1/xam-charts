[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/closureplease/mantri-cli.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/closureplease/mantri-cli)

Install this globally and you'll have access to the `mantri` command anywhere on your system.

```shell
npm install -g mantri-cli
```

See the mantri [Getting Started](http://mantrijs.com/getting-started) guide for more information.


## Installing mantri-cli locally
If you don't have administrator rights, you may need to install mantri-cli locally to your project using `npm install mantri-cli --save-dev`.  Unfortunately, this will not put the `mantri` executable in your PATH.  You'll need to specify its explicit location when executing it, eg: `./node_modules/.bin/mantri`,

Note: Using mantri-cli in this way is unsupported.
